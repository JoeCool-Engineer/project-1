    "# Project 1 Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "This directory contains synthetic datasets for exploring SVD analysis and covariance estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Descriptions\n",
    "\n",

    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "These datasets are designed to demonstrate different aspects of SVD analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Correlated data shows how covariance structure affects principal components\n",
    "2. Scale-varying data demonstrates the importance of normalization\n",
    "3. Low-rank data illustrates dimensionality reduction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "Datasets are generated using `generate_datasets.py`. To regenerate:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python generate_datasets.py\n",
    "```\n"
