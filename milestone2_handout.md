# Milestone 2: Feature Analysis Implementation
**Due: Should be finished by 2/18/2025**

## Overview
In this milestone, you will implement the analysis of variable importance and scaling effects, building on the theoretical foundation from Milestone 1. You'll create code to analyze how different features contribute to the overall variance in your data, with special attention to the linear algebraic structure of your transformations.

## Objectives
1. Implement variable importance analysis through subspace decomposition
2. Create scale normalization procedures that preserve key matrix properties
3. Develop initial SVD code structure with focus on numerical stability
4. Analyze the effects of different normalization approaches on eigenstructure

## Key Concepts to Demonstrate
1. Understanding of how scaling affects fundamental subspaces
2. Connection between variable importance and row/column spaces
3. Role of condition number in numerical stability
4. Relationship between scaling and eigenvalue distribution
