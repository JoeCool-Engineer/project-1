# Final Project Submission: Statistical Estimation through SVD Analysis
**Due: 2/25/2025**

## Overview
The final submission builds on your work from Milestones 1 and 2, completing the implementation and analysis of SVD-based statistical estimation. You'll demonstrate both theoretical understanding and practical implementation skills.

## Final Deliverables

### 1. Complete Implementation (30%)
- Full SVD and PCA implementations
- Comparison of direct SVD vs sklearn PCA
- Analysis of explained variance ratios
- Component selection analysis

### 2. Analysis and Results (30%)
- Scree plot analysis and interpretation
- Component selection methodology comparison:
  * Elbow method
  * Percentage of variance explained
  * Kaiser criterion
- Convergence analysis with sample size
- Dimensionality effects study

### 3. Connection to Fundamental Theorem (20%)
- Explain how the four fundamental subspaces relate to covariance analysis:
  * Row Space: Directions of non-zero variance in feature space
  * Column Space: Span of possible covariance combinations
  * Null Space: Directions of zero variance (linear dependencies)
  * Left Null Space: Orthogonal complement to sample covariance structure

- Demonstrate how FTLA dimensions apply to covariance matrices:
  * dim(Row) = dim(Col) = rank
  * dim(Null) + rank = n
  * Relationship to sample size and feature count

- Analyze implications for estimation:
  * How sample size affects rank
  * When covariance matrix becomes singular
  * Connection to principal components

### 4. Presentation and Documentation (20%)
- Final presentation slides
- Technical documentation
- Code demonstration
- Analysis results visualization
